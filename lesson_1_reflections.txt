How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

I used FC in Windows but same concept. It pinpointed lines that were different which made it easier to realize what had changed between the two files 



How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
