When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

It would be preferrable to maintain a remote repository if you are working on more than one computer
or if you are collaborating with others, since they would not have access to your local machine.  It would also
make sense to back up to a remote repository in case of hardware failure.
